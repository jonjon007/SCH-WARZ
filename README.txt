SCH-WARZ* (Battleship!) Readme

This project was compelted entirely by Jonathan Martin.

This project only runs on LOCALHOST, so there will be two windows
on a single computer that represent two players.

- To run the game, make sure the Battleship server is running
first, then run the client. There is not need to open the sounds
file. (Make sure your volume is up, though!)
- The client will open two windows, on directly on top of the other.
Drag the top window out of the way to see the other.
- If both windows are counting down at the same time, re-run the
client program.
- The game will start with randomly a generated ship formation.
- Once the game is running, take turns clicking on the grid to
take an attempt at hitting your adversary.
- At times, when you click on a spot, nothing will happen. This is a
courtesy spot. Nothing is there, but you won't lose a turn by
on it as if it were a miss. Give it another shot!
- When you win, you'll hear a Schwarzenegger catchphrase in echoes!
Who will have the last word?!
- To replay a game, simply re-run the client.

Get ready: "IT'S SHOWTIME!"

*Visuals are original, created from scratch, minus the edited
Schwarzenegger pictures.
*Sounds were taken from Schwarzenegger movies and a 
Schwarzenegger impersonator from a good ol' kids show.
